# PredictingLoans
Machine learning approaches for predicting loans status
Test codes for implementing a standard logistic regression, CatBoost classification (an improved gradient boost package compared to light GBM and XGboost, no need to treat Categorical variables explicitly) and a probabilistic Neural Network (fully connected MLP) using pymc3 (main feature is being able to quantify uncertainty of parameters and weights).
Data used are from All Lending Club loan data from Kaggle.
